// Before I explain how to set up a player I want to go ahead and say
// You don't have to change any settings on the player unless you want too.
// Otherwise it is beautiful right out of the box!
// The only reason you would need to change any settings is what kind of environment
// Your level is. Otherwise, it's a good default set up.
//
// Now - how to set this up.
//
// First Option -
// Go to Prefabs and drag and drop where you want the player at.
// Replace the "Player" with your own, not Standard_Player or WebPlayer_Player-
// but the one inside it called "Player" that is a child of both Standard and WebPlayer.
// Keep the MicrophoneInput child, and put it as a child onto your next player model you decide to use.
//
// Second Option, set up your player the way you want now center your scene view onto your player model
// by pressing F after selecting your player. Now create a sphere and make sure it is centered to your
// player and INSIDE your players body so no accidents happen if you aren't making noise.
// Now player either (Standard, or WebPlayerMic) onto the sphere and make the Sphere a child
// of your player.
